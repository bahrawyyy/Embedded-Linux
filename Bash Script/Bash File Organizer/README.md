# Bash file organizer
Bash script that organizes files in a specified directory based on their file types into separate subdirectories.

- Arguments: Directory path
- Output: Create subdirectories based on the file extensions (e.g., "txt" for text files, "jpg" for image files).
- Files with unknown or no file extensions should be placed in a "misc" subdirectory.
- If a subdirectory for a particular file type already exists, the script should move the files into that existing directory.
- The script should handle edge cases, such as files with no extensions or hidden files (those starting with a dot).
